# Meta_Analysis
In this study, we compare results from 11 recent studies evaluating the effect of conditional cash transfers on total food consumption. Combining data from experiments run across the globe, we test the external validity of the notion that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs increase food consumption in target populations. We encounter an overall positive effect; however, we also find evidence of a publication bias and extensive heterogeneity across studies. We conduct a meta-regression analysis to fine-tune model specification further and glean insights about the study characteristics which contribute more to effect sizes than others, as well as the extent to which they explain the effects observed. Using the data, the study attempts to address the observed heterogeneity and suggests a replicable framework to evaluate future research.
